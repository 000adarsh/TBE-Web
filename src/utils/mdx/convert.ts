Welcome to Building PharmaSift Part 1. In this part, We’ll build the base version of the User Interface with HTML, CSS, and some “Extra Skills”(That’ll be discussed later).

# **Problem Statement**

Before we talk anything about the project. Let’s understand first what problem are we trying to solve.

Let’s start by understanding how Pharmaceutical companies reach you with their medicines. Take an example of a Medicine used for fever. This med is manufactured by Pharmaceutical companies and distributed across the country at state-level & district level.

With this distribution network, medicine costs increase and we pay a lot for commissions of middle. And that is our core problem.

But we’re not solving it ourselves. Gov. has a scheme that lets you buy medicine at a much cheaper price not because of subsidy but because of the D2C model.

Now what’s D2C? D2C means Direct to Customer. This means the Government manufactures a medicine for Fever and sells you directly via their Medical centers.

Take an example. There are meds for Fever that cost 10 rupees but the same medicine costs 3 at Gov. powered Medical Stores named Jan(People) Aushadhi(Medicine) Kendra(Center).

Just imagine how disruptive it sounds.

Our job is to build a Medicine Comparison Platform that compares Outside Medicines to these Gov. Manufactured Meds. It’s that simple.

# What will you learn?

You’ll learn a lot of things from Designing, Thinking, and developing. Let’s get into it -

1. You’ll learn how to **Design a Tech Product.**
2. You’ll learn **Layoutting in HTML & CSS.**
3. You’ll learn to **Build with Tailwind.**
