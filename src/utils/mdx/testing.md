### Challenge

Can you calculate the total amount of a shopping cart based on item prices and quantities? This challenge will help you practice arithmetic operations and working with arrays of objects.

### Explanation

In this challenge, you'll write a program to compute the total amount for a shopping cart. Each item in the cart has a price and quantity. You'll sum up the cost of each item to get the total amount.

**Input -**

- `cart` (an array of objects, where each object contains `price` (a number) and `quantity` (a number))

**Output -** The total amount of the shopping cart.

**Example:**

- Input: `cart = [{ price: 100, quantity: 2 }, { price: 200, quantity: 1 }, { price: 50, quantity: 4 }]`
- Output: `500`
- Input: `cart = [{ price: 30, quantity: 3 }, { price: 15, quantity: 2 }]`
- Output: `105`

### Assignments

Test your skills with these shopping cart challenges:

1. **Calculate Total Bill:**
   - **Task:** Write a program to calculate the total bill amount for a list of purchased items. Each item has a price and quantity.
   - **Input:** `items` (an array of objects with `price` and `quantity` properties)
   - **Output:** The total bill amount.
   - **Example:**
     - Input: `items = [{ price: 200, quantity: 3 }, { price: 50, quantity: 5 }]`
     - Output: `650`
     - Input: `items = [{ price: 10, quantity: 7 }, { price: 5, quantity: 4 }]`
     - Output: `78`
2. **Calculate Grocery Bill:**
   - **Task:** Write a program to calculate the total amount for a grocery list. Each grocery item has a unit price and quantity.
   - **Input:** `groceryList` (an array of objects with `unitPrice` and `quantity` properties)
   - **Output:** The total amount for the grocery list.
   - **Example:**
     - Input: `groceryList = [{ unitPrice: 20, quantity: 2 }, { unitPrice: 15, quantity: 3 }]`
     - Output: `85`
     - Input: `groceryList = [{ unitPrice: 7, quantity: 5 }, { unitPrice: 3, quantity: 8 }]`
     - Output: `59`
3. **Calculate Total Invoice Amount:**
   - **Task:** Write a program to compute the total amount for an invoice. Each invoice item has a price and quantity.
   - **Input:** `invoice` (an array of objects with `price` and `quantity` properties)
   - **Output:** The total amount of the invoice.
   - **Example:**
     - Input: `invoice = [{ price: 50, quantity: 10 }, { price: 25, quantity: 4 }]`
     - Output: `250`
     - Input: `invoice = [{ price: 100, quantity: 1 }, { price: 40, quantity: 2 }]`
     - Output: `180`
