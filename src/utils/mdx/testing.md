**Input -**

- `numbers` (an array of integers where each integer is a number in the list)

**Output -** The maximum number in the array.

**Example:**

- Input: `numbers = [12, 45, 23, 67, 34]`
- Output: `67`
- Input: `numbers = [5, 1, 8, 9, 2]`
- Output: `9`

### Assignments

Test your skills with these maximum element challenges:

1. **Highest Score:**

     - Input: `denominations = [1, 5, 10, 20]`
     - Output: `20`
3. **Maximum Temperature:**
   - **Task:** Write a program to find the highest temperature recorded in a week from a list of daily temperatures.
   - **Input:** `temperatures` (an array of integers representing temperatures for each day)
   - **Output:** The highest temperature.
   - **Example:**
     - Input: `temperatures = [30, 32, 28, 35, 33, 29, 31]`
     - Output: `35`
     - Input: `temperatures = [25, 27, 22, 26, 24, 28]`
